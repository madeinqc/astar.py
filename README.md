# astar.py
A-Star algorithm in python

The a-star provided in this repo require you to provide a function to generate the possible neighbors and an heuristic.
This allow the algorithm to be more flexible and fit a better range of problems.

An example implementation of the neighbors and heuristic methods are provided in ```main.py``` as well as an example.

# TODO
* Change the main.py example to parse from file instead of hardcoding.
